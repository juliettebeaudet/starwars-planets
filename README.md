## StarWars React Project
The current project was created twice to use both Redux and Context API.
Here and [there](https://github.com/tryber/sd-05-block16-project-react-redux-starwars-database-filters/pull/14), you have access to the Redux coding, whereas the project refactored with Context & Hooks is available on [this link](https://github.com/tryber/sd-05-project-starwars-datatable-hooks/pull/12/files).

For both, a mocked version of the official SWAPI (Star Wars API) created by [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) school was fetched and rendered: [swapi-trybe](https://swapi-trybe.herokuapp.com/documentation).
