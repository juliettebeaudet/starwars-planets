## StarWars React Project

#### About the project
The StarWars Planets' Search Engine provides the opportunity for StarWars fans to search for and filter planets according to numerous criterias.
This project was developed as a compulsory Front-End training assignment given by [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) Full-Stack Software Development School.

#### Technical questions
The current project was created twice to use both Redux and Context API (& Hooks).
Here and [there](https://github.com/tryber/sd-05-block16-project-react-redux-starwars-database-filters/pull/14), you have access to the Redux coding, whereas the project refactored with Context & Hooks is available on [this link](https://github.com/tryber/sd-05-project-starwars-datatable-hooks/pull/12/files).

For both, a mocked version of the official SWAPI (Star Wars API) was created, fetched and rendered: [swapi-trybe](https://swapi-trybe.herokuapp.com/documentation).
